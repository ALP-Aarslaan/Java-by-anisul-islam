        class d extends b,c{
        ....
        }
        this type of overriding is not applicable in java
        this is called multiple inheritance
        both classes are in same level with same priority
        if we want to use f method from d class object leads to
        ambiguity(hesitation) this is called diamond problem.
        by using interface we can solve this problem
