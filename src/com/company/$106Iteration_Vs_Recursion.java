        difference between iteration and recursion:
        1.in iteration we use loop but in recursion we use if else switch etc
        2.iteration stops when condition becomes false
        but recursion stops when base case appear
        3.iteration fast,but recursion slow depending on algorithm;
        4.during iteration codes get bigger ,but during we code using recursion
        code gets smaller
