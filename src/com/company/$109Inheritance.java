        inheritance is a way of calling one class to another which has
        same variable and data types;
        such as ypu created a class person{
        String name;
        int age;
        void display(){
        //method
        }
        }
        and again we created a class teacher {
        which has also name and age data
        so we no need to use it again we can use persons class method using a
        keyword extends like:
        class teacher extend persons{
        void display1(){
        display();
        String qualification;
        }
        }
        here teacher class inherits person class
        person class is known as base ,parent,super class
        teacher class is child class ,sub class that inherits
         */
    }
