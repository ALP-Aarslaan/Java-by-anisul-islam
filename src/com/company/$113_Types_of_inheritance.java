        there are 4 types of inheritance:
        1.Single inheritance
        2.Multilevel inheritance
        3.hierarchical inheritance
        4.multiple inheritance

        single inheritance:
        class a and class b;
        a inherits b this is an example of single inheritance

        multilevel inheritance:
        if b class inherits a and c class inherits or extends b is called
        multilevel inheritance

        hierarchical inheritance:
        if b,c,d class inherits a single class a then it is called hierarchical
        inheritance

        multiple inheritance:
        java doesn't support it.
        if b and c inherits a but d inherits b and c both its called multiple
        inheritance
        we use interface to create multiple inheritance
