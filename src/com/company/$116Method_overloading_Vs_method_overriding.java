        method overloading and overriding difference:
        1.method over loading happens in a single class but,
        overriding happens at least between 2 class
        2.method overloading's parameters must be different but,
        method overriding's parameters must be same
        3.method overloading has no inheritance but method overriding has
        inheritance;
        4.return type may be same in method over loading but in the case of method
        overriding return type must be same
        5.method overloading doesn't hide one method to another
        but
        in method overriding  child method hides parent method
