        what is exception:
        ans:its an run time error
        exception is an abnormal condition arises in a code during run time
        example:
        int x=10;
        int y=0;
        int result=x/y;
        different types of exception:
        1.arithmetic exception;
        2.null pointer exception;
        3.index out of bound exception;
        4.number format exception;
        5.file not found exception;
        6.array index out of bound exception;
        exception hierarchy;
        what is exception handling:
        ans:it is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the run time error
        exception handling is managed by 5 keywords.
        1.try;
        2.catch;
        3.finally;
        4.throw;
        5.throws;
        try:
        try{
        // code you want to monitor;
        }
        try block throws when a exception is found and catch block catches the
        error in order to handle it
        there may be multiple catch block;
        catch:
        catch(exceptionType e1){
        //exception handler for exception
        }
        catch(exceptionType e2){
        //exception handler for exception
        }
        ...
        finally{
        //block of code to be executed after try block
        }
         */
    }
