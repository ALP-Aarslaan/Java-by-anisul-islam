        here we will learn about difference between constructor and a method
        1:constructor name must be same as its class name
        but methods name can be anything.
        2.constructor doesn't have any return type but method must have a return
        type
        3.we don't need to call constructor in main program
        but method needs calling
        4.using constructor we initialize an object
        but using method we controls,prints behaviour of an object
